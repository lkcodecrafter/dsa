# 36. Valid Sudoku
Medium


Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:

- Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
- Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
- Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.

Note:
- A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
- Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.
 

Example 1:

```
Input: board = 
[["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
Output: true
```
Example 2:
```
Input: board = 
[["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
Output: false
```
Explanation: Same as Example 1, except with the 5 in the top left corner being modified to 8. Since there are two 8's in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it is invalid.
 

Constraints:

- board.length == 9
- board[i].length == 9
- board[i][j] is a digit 1-9 or '.'.

```java
// My Solution
class Solution {
    public boolean isValidSudoku(char[][] board) {
        
        for(int i = 0; i < 9; i++) {
            for(int j = 0; j < 9; j++) {
                char c = board[i][j];
                if(isDigit(c) && !isValid(c, i, j, board)) {
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }
    

/*
 * c - '0' < 0 means:

If the character c comes before '0' in ASCII, the result will be negative.

For example:

'0' in ASCII = 48

'/' in ASCII = 47

So '/' - '0' = 47 - 48 = -1 → less than 0 ✅

'a' - '0' = 97 - 48 = 49 → not less than 0 ❌

📌 In short:
c - '0' < 0 checks if c is not a digit and is smaller than '0', like symbols '/', '!', 'A' etc.

# Sudoku Validity Check - Simple Approach

### Problem:
Check if a given 9x9 Sudoku board is valid.  
Rules:  
- No duplicate digits in any **row**  
- No duplicate digits in any **column**  
- No duplicate digits in any **3x3 grid**  
- Ignore empty cells (like `'.'`)

---

### Approach:
1. Traverse each cell in the 9x9 board.
2. For each cell with a digit, check:  
   - Is this digit unique in its row?  
   - Is this digit unique in its column?  
   - Is this digit unique in its 3x3 sub-grid?
3. If any check fails, return **false**.
4. If all pass, return **true**.

---

### Code Explanation:

- `isDigit(c)`: Checks if `c` is a digit between '0' and '9'.  
- `isValid(c, i, j, board)`: Returns true if digit `c` is unique in row `i`, column `j`, and 3x3 grid.  
- `isValidRow(c, row, col, board)`: Checks no duplicate `c` in row except current column.  
- `isValidCol(c, row, col, board)`: Checks no duplicate `c` in column except current row.  
- `isValidGrid(c, row, col, board)`: Checks no duplicate `c` in the 3x3 box except current cell.

---

### How 3x3 grid is found:
- Calculate starting row of grid: `3 * (row / 3)`  
- Calculate starting col of grid: `3 * (col / 3)`  
- Check all cells in this 3x3 box.

private boolean isDigit(char c) {
    if(c - '0' > 9 || c - '0' < 0)
        return false;
    return true;
}

is checking whether the character c is a digit ('0' to '9') — but it’s written in a slightly math-y way.

How it works:
In Java, characters have ASCII values.

'0' has ASCII value 48, '1' is 49, ..., '9' is 57.

When you do:
c - '0'

it gives the numeric value of that digit.

Example: '5' - '0' = 53 - 48 = 5

'A' - '0' would be some unrelated positive number.

if(c - '0' > 9 || c - '0' < 0)
    return false;

If the result is less than 0 → c is before '0' in ASCII table (not a digit).

If the result is greater than 9 → c is after '9' (not a digit).

Otherwise, it’s between 0 and 9 → it’s a digit.

✅ Short meaning:
This is basically a manual check for:

 
if(c >= '0' && c <= '9')
but written using subtraction.

Character   ASCII Value   c - '0' Result
-----------------------------------------
'0'         48            0
'1'         49            1
'2'         50            2
'3'         51            3
'4'         52            4
'5'         53            5
'6'         54            6
'7'         55            7
'8'         56            8
'9'         57            9
-----------------------------------------
':'         58            10  (Not a digit)
'A'         65            17  (Not a digit)
'/'         47            -1  (Not a digit)

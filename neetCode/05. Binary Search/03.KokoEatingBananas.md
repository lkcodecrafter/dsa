# [875. Koko Eating Bananas](https://leetcode.com/problems/koko-eating-bananas/)
Medium


Koko loves to eat bananas. There are n piles of bananas, the ith pile has piles[i] bananas. The guards have gone and will come back in h hours.

Koko can decide her bananas-per-hour eating speed of k. Each hour, she chooses some pile of bananas and eats k bananas from that pile. If the pile has less than k bananas, she eats all of them instead and will not eat any more bananas during this hour.

Koko likes to eat slowly but still wants to finish eating all the bananas before the guards return.

Return the minimum integer k such that she can eat all the bananas within h hours.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: piles = [3,6,7,11], h = 8
Output: 4
```
Example 2:
```
Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 5
Output: 30
```
Example 3:
```
Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 6
Output: 23
``` 

Constraints:

- 1 <= piles.length <= 10<sup>4</sup>
- piles.length <= h <= 10<sup>9</sup>
- 1 <= piles[i] <= 10<sup>9</sup>

## Approach
```
- Binary search on range (1, max(pile))
- while the condition satisfies go towards left half
- else go towards right half
```

## Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int minEatingSpeed(int[] piles, int h) {
        int left = 1, right = piles[0];
        for(int pile : piles) {
            if(pile < left)
                left = pile;
            if(pile > right)
                right = pile;
        }
        int result = right;
        while(left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right-left)/2;
            if(isSatisfy(piles, mid, h)) {
                result = Math.min(result, mid);
                right = mid-1;
            } else {
                left = mid+1;
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
    
    private boolean isSatisfy(int[] piles, int mid, int h) {
        int count = 0;
        for(int pile : piles) {
            count += (pile/mid);
            if(pile%mid != 0)
                count++;
        }
        return count <= h;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis
```
- Time Complexity:  O(n*logm), m: max(piles)
- Space Complexity: O(1)
```


```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    
    // Function to check if Koko can finish all bananas in h hours with speed k
    public static boolean canFinish(int[] piles, int k, int h) {
        int totalTime = 0;
        for (int pile : piles) {
            // Calculate the time required for the current pile with speed k
            totalTime += (pile + k - 1) / k; // This is equivalent to Math.ceil(pile / k)
        }
        return totalTime <= h; // Can Koko finish in h hours?
    }

    // Main function to find the minimum k
    public static int minEatingSpeed(int[] piles, int h) {
        // Binary search range for the eating speed k
        int low = 1, high = Arrays.stream(piles).max().getAsInt();  // Start from k = 1 to k = max(piles)

        // Perform binary search to find the minimum k
        while (low < high) {
            int mid = (low + high) / 2;  // Calculate mid point
            if (canFinish(piles, mid, h)) {
                high = mid;  // Try smaller speed if possible
            } else {
                low = mid + 1;  // Otherwise increase speed
            }
        }

        return low;  // This will be the minimum k that allows Koko to finish in h hours
    }

    // Example usage
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] piles = {3, 6, 7, 11};
        int h = 8;
        System.out.println("Minimum eating speed: " + minEatingSpeed(piles, h));  // Output: 4
    }
}
```

1. Set the low bound to 1 (minimum speed).
2. Set the high bound to the max pile size (maximum speed).
3. While low < high:
   a. Calculate the midpoint: mid = (low + high) / 2
   b. If canFinish(mid) is true, set high = mid (try a smaller speed)
   c. Else, set low = mid + 1 (increase the speed)
4. Return low as the minimum speed.

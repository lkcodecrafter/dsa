# [42. Trapping Rain Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/)
Hard


Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. 
In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
Output: 9
 ```

Constraints:

- n == height.length
- 1 <= n <= 2 * 10<sup>4</sup>
- 0 <= height[i] <= 10<sup>5</sup>

## Approach
### First Approach:
```
- leftMax array to keep the max element on the left of the index
- rightMax array to keep the max element on the right of the index
- at each index take the min(leftMax, rightMax) - heigh[index], if it's greater than 0 add it to ans
- Time : O(N)
- Space: O(N)
```
### Second Approach:
```
- instead of keep arrays to store the leftmax & rightMax, we can use two variables
- if leftMax <= rightMax
  - try to update leftMax
  - if min(leftMax, rightMax) - heigh[index] > 0, add it to ans
  - move the left pointer ahead
- else
  - same as above just replacing the left's by right
  - decrement the right pointer
```
## Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int trap(int[] height) {
        int left = 0, right = height.length-1;
        int lMax = height[0], rMax = height[right];
        int ans = 0;
        while(left <= right) {
            if(lMax <= rMax) {
                lMax = Math.max(lMax, height[left]);
                int val = Math.min(lMax, rMax)-height[left];
                ans += val < 0 ? 0 : val;
                left++;
            } else {
                rMax = Math.max(rMax, height[right]);
                int val = Math.min(lMax, rMax)-height[right];
                ans += val < 0 ? 0 : val;
                right--;
            }
        }       
        return ans;
    }
}

```
## Complexity Analysis
```
- Time Complexity: O(N) -> go through each elements of the height array
- Space Complexity: O(1)
```


# Trapping Rain Water — Two Pointers Approach

## Problem

Given `n` non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is `1`,  
compute how much water it can trap after raining.

---

## Example

height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6

## Approach: Two Pointers

We can solve this in **O(n)** time and **O(1)** space using two pointers.

### 1. Intuition

- Water trapped at any index depends on:
  - The tallest bar **to the left** of that index
  - The tallest bar **to the right** of that index
- Water at position `i` =  
  `min(maxLeft, maxRight) - height[i]` (if positive)

---

### 2. Steps

1. Initialize two pointers:
   - `left = 0`
   - `right = n - 1`
2. Keep track of:
   - `leftMax` = tallest bar from the left so far
   - `rightMax` = tallest bar from the right so far
3. While `left < right`:
   - If `height[left] < height[right]`:
     - If `height[left] >= leftMax`, update `leftMax`
     - Else, water trapped = `leftMax - height[left]`
     - Move `left++`
   - Else:
     - If `height[right] >= rightMax`, update `rightMax`
     - Else, water trapped = `rightMax - height[right]`
     - Move `right--`

---

### 3. Pseudocode

```java
public int trap(int[] height) {
    int left = 0, right = height.length - 1;
    int leftMax = 0, rightMax = 0;
    int water = 0;
    
    while (left < right) {
        if (height[left] < height[right]) {
            if (height[left] >= leftMax)
                leftMax = height[left];
            else
                water += leftMax - height[left];
            left++;
        } else {
            if (height[right] >= rightMax)
                rightMax = height[right];
            else
                water += rightMax - height[right];
            right--;
        }
    }
    return water;
}
4. Dry Run
Input:
 
[0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Process:
leftMax and rightMax keep increasing as we move inward.

Each time we find a bar lower than the current max, we know it can hold water.

Final trapped water = 6 units.

Time Complexity
O(n) — Single pass through the array.

Space Complexity
O(1) — Constant extra space.

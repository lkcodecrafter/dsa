/*
Context

We are running DFS, and we use two arrays:
visited[node] â†’ tells us if a node has ever been visited in any DFS run.
Once visited, it stays true permanently.
recStack[node] â†’ tells us if a node is part of the current DFS recursion path (active stack).

This is what helps us detect cycles.

That line:
else if (recStack[neighbor]) {
    return true; // Found cycle
}


This happens when:
The neighbor is already visited.
And it is still present in the current recursion stack.

ðŸ‘‰ Meaning:
We are trying to visit a node that is already in our current DFS path.
This indicates a back edge â†’ which means cycle exists in a directed graph.

Example Walkthrough (your graph)
0 â†’ 1 â†’ 2 â†’ 3
    â†‘       |
    â””â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”˜
Dry run:

Start DFS(0)
visited[0] = true, recStack[0] = true

DFS(1)
visited[1] = true, recStack[1] = true

DFS(2)
visited[2] = true, recStack[2] = true

DFS(3)
visited[3] = true, recStack[3] = true

From node 3, go to neighbor = 1

visited[1] = true already âœ…

recStack[1] = true â†’ means node 1 is still in current DFS path!

Boom ðŸ’¥ â†’ cycle detected.

Why do we need this check?

If we only checked visited[neighbor], we might falsely think every edge to a visited node is a cycle (which is wrong).
The key idea:

A back edge to a node in recursion stack = cycle
An edge to a visited node that is not in recursion stack = safe (not a cycle)

ðŸ‘‰ So, this line:

else if (recStack[neighbor])

is specifically detecting a back edge in a DFS tree, which is the definition of a cycle in directed graphs.

That line
if (!visited[neighbor] && dfsCycle(neighbor, adj, visited, recStack)) {
    return true;
}

ðŸ‘‰ Meaning:

!visited[neighbor] â†’ If the neighbor hasnâ€™t been visited yet, go deeper with DFS.
dfsCycle(neighbor, adj, visited, recStack) â†’ Run DFS recursively from that neighbor.
If that DFS call finds a cycle (returns true), we immediately return true all the way up.

ðŸ’¡ Think of it like delegating the search:

"I havenâ€™t visited my neighbor. Let me explore its entire path. If the neighborâ€™s DFS reports a cycle, I also report a cycle."

Why we backtrack

At the end of the function:

recStack[node] = false; // backtrack
When we enter a node in DFS, we mark:

visited[node] = true;
recStack[node] = true;   // "Iâ€™m in the current recursion path"

After exploring all neighbors, we remove the node from the recursion path:
recStack[node] = false;

Why is this needed?

Imagine DFS as walking down a path in a maze:
recStack = the footprints on your current path.
If you reach a function and see your own footprints again â†’ cycle!
But once you backtrack (return from recursion), you erase the footprints because youâ€™re no longer on that path.
If we donâ€™t backtrack (recStack[node] = false), nodes would stay forever marked as "on path", and every future edge to them would look
like a cycle (false positives).

Dry Run on Your Graph
Graph:

0 â†’ 1 â†’ 2 â†’ 3 â†’ 1  (cycle)


DFS(0): mark recStack[0] = true

DFS(1): mark recStack[1] = true

DFS(2): mark recStack[2] = true

DFS(3): mark recStack[3] = true

Neighbor = 1 â†’ already recStack[1] = true â†’ cycle âœ…

When DFS(3) finishes, it sets recStack[3] = false (backtracking).
Then DFS(2) sets recStack[2] = false, and so on.
This ensures only the current call stack is marked.

ðŸ”‘ Summary:

if (!visited[neighbor] && dfsCycle(...)) return true;
â†’ Explore new neighbors, propagate cycle detection up the recursion.

recStack[node] = false; // backtrack
â†’ Remove node from recursion path once done, so future DFS calls arenâ€™t confused.
